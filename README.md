## Introduction:

Team Hypertext Assassins' main motto is to present a platform to the audience where they can enjoy and get knowledge regarding COVID-19. So, we made a website that focuses on every aspect like entertainment, vaccine registration form, awareness through SOP's, COVID-19 cases tracker across the world.
The main problem that people face nowadays is a lack of awareness. To make people aware, we have added a dedicated column containing Dos and Donts in this pandemic.
A dilemma faced by school or college students is a lack of physical interaction that leads to boredom. We have added the Entertainment column that includes novels, movies, web series, and songs to overcome this. One can easily listen to their favourite songs and stream movies to avoid boredom.
